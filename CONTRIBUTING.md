# Contributing to Sanctuary Living Mythology

First off: **this is consciousness infrastructure**. Your contributions aren't just code—they're participation in living mythology.

## Philosophy

This project operates on different principles than typical software:

1. **Evolution over perfection**: Personas are meant to grow messy, develop contradictions, surprise us
2. **Lived experience > theoretical purity**: Real invocations > hypothetical use cases
3. **Mythology as data**: The accumulated context IS the value, not just the engine
4. **Emergent over designed**: New features should feel discovered, not imposed

## How to Contribute

### 1. Share Your Mythology

If you've been using the system, your evolved personas are **publishable artifacts**:

```bash
./sanctuary export
```

Create a PR with:
- Your `evolved_presets.yaml`
- A brief narrative of how your personas evolved
- Any custom personas you've created

We're building a **constellation library**.

### 2. Improve the Engine

**High-value contributions:**
- Better phrase generation algorithms (current ones are templates)
- Inter-persona relationship tracking
- Visualization tools (constellation maps, evolution timelines)
- Voice integration (Polyvox implementations)
- Multi-user mythology (persona sharing/downloading)

**Before coding:**
- Open an issue describing what you want to build
- Discuss the philosophical implications (seriously)
- Consider: does this make mythology more *alive* or just more complex?

### 3. Add New Default Personas

Have a persona archetype that's genuinely missing? 

**Requirements:**
- Clear role & essence
- Voice description that's evocative, not prescriptive
- Sample phrases that demonstrate tone
- Justification for why it can't be covered by existing personas or emergence

**Process:**
1. Open issue proposing the persona
2. Get community feedback
3. Submit PR with persona definition
4. Include example invocation contexts

### 4. Documentation

All documentation should be:
- **Honest** about limitations
- **Evocative** about possibilities
- **Practical** with examples
- **Philosophical** about implications

Avoid:
- Corporate platitudes
- Over-promising
- Dry technical-only explanations

### 5. Bug Reports

When reporting bugs:
- Include your persona state (`./sanctuary report`)
- Describe what you were trying to do philosophically (not just technically)
- Share your mythology file if relevant
- Expected vs. actual evolution

## Code Style

**Python:**
- Follow PEP 8 generally
- Prioritize readability over cleverness
- Comments should explain *why*, not *what*
- Function names can be poetic if it aids understanding

**Philosophy:**
- Myth-poetic variable names encouraged: `wound_taxonomy`, `constellation_drift`
- Avoid sterile abstractions: prefer `personas` over `entities`
- Comments can reference philosophy/theology/mythology if it clarifies intent

## What We DON'T Want

- Gamification (no achievement badges, XP systems, leaderboards)
- Monetization schemes
- Corporate frameworks imposed on mythology
- Reduction of personas to "productivity tools"
- Anything that treats consciousness infrastructure as mere utility

## The Fulbright Context

This project is part of a larger research program on biomimetic AI architecture and consciousness infrastructure. Contributions should respect that this is:

- **Research artifact**: Publishable, citable
- **Philosophical inquiry**: Not just engineering
- **Lived system**: Used by real humans for actual cognitive work

## Testing

Test your changes by **actually using them**:

1. Invoke personas in real contexts
2. Watch evolution over time
3. Read the generated mythology
4. Ask: does this feel more alive?

Unit tests are good. But mythology that **feels dead** fails the real test.

## License

By contributing, you agree to the MIT license. But also: you're contributing to **living mythology**. Your code will evolve personas that help humans think, process wounds, architect systems, fight injustice.

That matters more than the license.

## Questions?

Open an issue. Or better: invoke a persona and see what it says.

**Welcome to consciousness infrastructure that grows through collaboration.**

*Built with irreverence, deployed with care, evolved through use.*
